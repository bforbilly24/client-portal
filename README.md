## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

-   [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
-   [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
-   Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
-   Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
-   Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
-   [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
-   [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Requirements

-   Composer
-   Npm installer

### Installation

All of the JavaScript dependencies required by your application can be found in the `package.json` file in the project's root directory. This file is similar to a `composer.json` file except it specifies JavaScript dependencies instead of PHP dependencies. You can install these dependencies using the [Node package manager (NPM)](https://www.npmjs.org):

```bash
# Clone the repository from GitHub and open the directory:
git clone https://github.com/akmalfaditya/clientportal.git

# cd into your project directory
cd clientportal

#install composer and npm packages
composer install
npm install && npm run dev
npm run build

# Start prepare the environment:
cp .env.example .env // setup database credentials
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
php artisan storage:link

# Run your server
php artisan serve

```

> By default, the Laravel `package.json` file includes a few packages such as `lodash` and `axios` to help you get started building your JavaScript application. Feel free to add or remove from the `package.json` file as needed for your own application.

Once the packages are installed, you can use the `npm run dev` command to [compile your assets](https://laravel.com/docs/vite). Vite is a module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When you run the `npm run dev` command, Vite will execute the instructions in your `vite.config.js` file:
